notes for portfolio site

copy: 
Heya, my name is Michael. I'm a web developer, illustrator, writer and
apparently balding according to my finance. 
(I'm too young to be balding :()

I've been a part of lots of cool things. Check them out.  

If you want me to help you with something cool, or want to chat about
what I've done, shoot me an email. 

Check out my dog. She is the prettiest dog.

in one day)
